# Global Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker
This is a data visualization project that illustrates global vaccine statistics using Tableau. I use a variety of KPIs such as the percentages of fully, partially, and unvaccinated people globally. I extend the visualization to communicate the relationship between vaccination rates and GDP per capita. 
Data can be found in country_vaccinations.csv which is sourced from a public data set. The aim of the project is to visualize the the world's success in combatting the effects of COVID-19. It illustrates countries that have successfully implemented measures to combat the pandemic, and also shows which countries are still struggling and need global assistance.
