# Global Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker
This is a data visualization project that illustrates global vaccine statistics using Tableau. I use a variety of KPIs such as the percentages of fully, partially, and unvaccinated people globally. I extend the visualization to communicate the relationship between vaccination rates and GDP per capita. 
Data can be found in country_vaccinations.xlsx which is sourced from a public data set.
