# Global Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker
This is a data visualization project that visualizes global vaccine statistics using Tableau. I use a variety of KPIs such as the percentages of fully, partially, and unvaccinated people globally. I extend the visualization to illustrate the relationship between vaccination rates and GDP per capita.
